# Grandfather Clock Audio Emulator

Author: Evan Coury

I have fond childhood memories of my grandparents' epic grandfather clock filling their home with its pleasant Westminister Quarters chimes every 15 minutes. I wanted to be able to experience that nostolgia without actually buying a grandfather clock, but was suprisingly unable to find anything online that simply plays the quarterly and hourly chimes and runs in a browser.

This simply plays the Westminster Quarters chimes at 15, 30, and 45 past the hour and the main chime at the top of the hour. The samples seemed a little faster than I remember, so I defaulted playback to 0.88x.
